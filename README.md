# sleep_tracker
template for tracking sleep for each half-hour period of the day

**********
***must turn on iterative calculation at least up to the number of days you're tracking***
**********

mark a 1 for if you were asleep in a given half-hour interval, and it will automatically turn blue and go toward the total sleep that day - rounding is of course necessary in some instances - otherwise, leave it blank

sums the total of sleep per day, calculates an n-day average, and an n-day standard deviation, taking the n days as a population rather than a sample

adjustable n-day average and n-day standard deviation graphs, using the two numbers at the very end of the first row

the "next day" starts tracking at 7 pm to account for going to sleep before midnight - there is a dark vertical line at 7 pm for this purpose
